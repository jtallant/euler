# My Project Euler Solutions

This repo contains my solutions to problems found on [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/)

Most if not all solutions will be in Ruby. Most solutions will come with tests. Project Euler is a fun way to improve your programming skills. Try to solve the problems on your own before looking at any of my solutions. Feel free to comment on a solution and suggest improvements.
